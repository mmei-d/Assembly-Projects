"BubbleSort.s" is the bubble sort algorithm but in assembly code.

"GCD.s" calculates the greatest common denominator (GCD) of two numbers A and B without using a division operation.

"InsertList" is a recursive function in the program "InsertList.s" that maintains a sorted list in ascending order. It returns the address of the first element of the new list.
